      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Southside Dog Haven was born out of a deep love for animals and a desire to provide a stress-free, safe alternative to traditional kennels. Our founder has cared for dogs for over 10 years and knows how important it is for them to feel loved, secure, and never alone.</p>
